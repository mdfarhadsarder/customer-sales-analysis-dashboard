# customer-sales-analysis-dashboard
This project aims to perform a comprehensive analysis of a retail sales dataset. The workflow includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, visualization of key business metrics, and deriving actionable insights. The dataset will first be assessed for data quality issues, such as missing values and inconsistent data types. After cleaning, descriptive statistics and visual exploration will be performed to understand sales trends, product performance, and customer behavior. The project will conclude with a summary of findings and recommendations based on the analysis. All work will be documented and presented in Jupyter Notebooks and Power BI dashboards to create a complete data science case study.
